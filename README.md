## Introduction

Provide a short overview of the project’s purpose, the problem it solves, and the primary audience. Mention any notable design decisions, such as language, framework, or architectural approach.

- **Scope**: What the project does, what it does not do.
- **Audience**: End users, developers, contributors, or operators.

---

## Features

- List the key features and capabilities.
- Example:
  - Upload and manage files via a simple interface
  - Python-based CLI and library for automation
  - Configurable workflows with pluggable modules
  - Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux/macOS)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python version (e.g., Python 3.9+)
- pip or another package manager
- Optional: virtual environment support (venv, conda)
- Other dependencies (e.g., Docker, Node.js) if applicable

### Installation

Option A — from PyPI (if distributed as a Python package)

```bash
pip install your-package-name
```

Option B — from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

- Explain configuration files (e.g., `config.yaml`, `settings.json`) and environment variables.
- Include default values and example fragments.
- If the project uses secrets, describe how to securely provide them (e.g., environment variables, secret managers).

Example `config.yaml` snippet:

```yaml
# config.yaml
app:
  port: 8080
  debug: false

upload:
  storage: local
  path: ./uploads

logging:
  level: INFO
  format: "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(level)s - %(message)s"
```

---

## Usage

### CLI

Provide usage examples for the command-line interface.

```bash
# Basic usage
your-cli --help

# Upload a file
your-cli upload --file path/to/file.txt --destination /remote/path

# Run a workflow
your-cli run --workflow my_workflow.yaml
```

### Library/API

If this project exposes a Python API, show typical usage.

```python
from your_package import uploader, workflow

# Initialize components
u = uploader.LocalUploader(base_path="/uploads")
w = workflow.Workflow(config_path="config.yaml")

# Upload a file
u.upload("path/to/file.txt", "/remote/path")

# Execute a predefined workflow
result = w.execute("my_workflow")
```

---

## Project Structure

```

Notes:
- Use your actual module names and structure.
- If you don’t have a multi-module layout, adjust accordingly.

## Development & Testing

### Testing

- Explain test framework (e.g., pytest, unittest).
- How to run tests:

```bash
pytest -q
```

- How to run subset tests:

```bash
pytest tests/test_uploader.py -q
```

### Linting & Formatting

- Lint: flake8, pylint, or standard
- Formatting: black

Example:

```bash
# Lint
flake8 src tests

# Format
black .
```

### Continuous Integration

- Outline CI setup (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Mention key workflows (lint, test, build, release).

Example GitHub Actions mention:

- CI runs flake8, pytest on push and pull requests.
- Coverage reports generated by pytest-cov.

---

## Code Quality & Documentation

- Style guidelines (PEP 8, docstring conventions)
- Documentation strategy (Sphinx, MkDocs)
- API docs generation commands

Example:

```bash
# Generate docs with Sphinx
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
cd docs
make html
```

- How to read the in-repo docs and how to contribute to docs.

---

## Deployment

- How to deploy (on-prem, cloud, containers)
- Docker usage (if applicable)

Docker example:

```bash
# Build
docker build -t your-image-name:latest .

# Run
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e CONFIG_PATH=/config/config.yaml your-image-name:latest
```

Kubernetes example (if applicable):

- Deployment manifest
- Service exposure

---

## Security & Compliance

- Data handling and privacy notes
- Secrets management guidance
- Dependency management and vulnerability scanning

---

## Changelog

- Keep a CHANGELOG with semantic versioning.
- Summarize notable changes, fixes, and enhancements per release.

Example:

```
## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-31
### Added
- Initial release with core upload and workflow capabilities.

### Fixed
- Minor bug fixes in path normalization.

### Changed
- Updated configuration format.
```

---

## Contributing

- How to fork, branch naming conventions, and PR process.
- Include a short code of conduct and contribution guidelines.

Example:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `feature/awesome-feature`
3. Open a PR describing the feature and tests
4. Ensure tests pass and CI checks succeed

---

## License

- State the license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) and include a short blurb about rights and limitations.

---

## Acknowledgments

- Credit contributors, sponsors, or references.

If you can share more details about your project (programming language, primary modules, specific workflows, command-line interfaces, whether it uses Docker, etc.), I can tailor this README precisely to your repository and add exact code examples, config file schemas, and usage commands.
